I made this for a friend who is a novice programmer and needs to write
code for his thesis. I do think that every programmer needs to be reminded
of these things every now and then.

<h2 id="best-practices-for-programming">Best practices for Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-best-practices-for-programming">
<p>
I'm a firm believer that the best practices common in software
engineering are important for any kind of programming. Even small
programs can benefit from these practices in a simple form. There are a
lot of different opinions about the specifics and starategies involved,
but the principles themselves are not controversial in software
engineering circles. If there is one overarching theme here it is: be
kind to whoever works with your code, <i>which includes your future self</i>.
</p>

<p>
Programming is a lot of delayed gratification: effort
now for clean, simple code saves a lot more effort next week, or even
tomorrow. It's fine for your discipline to slip: there will be a lot of
times you don't see the point in applying these principles.
</p>

<p>
If you don't understand
why the principle should be used in your case; skip it rather than
applying it blindly.
</p>

<p>
You will probably see that not following the principle backfires; but next time you will know
<i>why</i>, and apply the principle intentionally.
</p>

<p>
I should note that by far the best way to learn these things is from
working alongside someone. It's difficult to see at first how these
ideas apply to your own case. 
</p>

<p>
I'll give a quick overview here, the rest of the document is expanding
on each of these points. Don't be overwhelmed by the details in the
rest: applying the basic principles to some extent helps plenty already.
</p>

<p>
If you're struggling, don't worry about it; applying these practices well
is really difficult, and the only way to get good at it is to learn by doing.
As a magical cartoon dog once said: "Sucking at something is the first step
 towards being kinda good at something".

<div id="outline-container-practices-to-follow" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="practices-to-follow">Practices to follow:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-practices-to-follow">
<p>
These practices help both to ensure the quality of the code you are
working on, but also to improve your skill over time.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Version control: use software like git to track your changes and
store different versions of your code.</li>
<li>Code review: have others give you feedback on your code if possible,
return to your code to reflect on it yourself if not</li>
<li>Automated testing: write automated tests of your code (at least the
most complex and/or important parts), and run these each time you
make changes to verify you didn't accidentally break something.</li>
<li>Abstraction and specification: for each piece of your program, define
specifically <i>what</i> it should do (inputs, outputs, usage) before you
worry about <i>how</i> it should do it. If you are not sure, there are certain
techniques that can help give you a clearer picture.
TODO: rephrase this, change the emphasis</li>
</ol>

<p>
Version control and code review can be easily combined by using a
repository hosting tool like github, which lets you upload your version
history and contains tools for reviewing the changes made. Automated
testing and abstraction and specification can be combined by using a
Test-driven development workflow: where tests are written first, and
satisfied afterwards by implementing.

<p>
Concrete actions that promote writing good code and improving

</div>

<div id="outline-container-version-control" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="version-control">Version control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-version-control">
<p>
If you're already using version control, this may seem banal; but I've
worked with computer science graduates who simply chucked previous
versions into a folder called OLD. The main reason for using version
control is to ensure that when you make a change which breaks something,
you can always go back to a previous version. It is important in this
case to save a new version often. Used properly, version control
software offers a variety of other benefits too: including documenting
the changes made and integrating with other practices here. It lets you
safely explore different ways of doing things, different changes and
features without fear of mucking up the rest - and stores the result in
a findable way in case you choose to use it after all.
</p>

<p>
The most commonly used version control software is Git.
It is tricky software to understand, but fortunately you don't need
to undestand it very deeply to use it.
A few of its main features and a willingness to google will suffice.
</p>

<p>
There are plenty of tutorials
on the basic commands, but they often leave out the structure of git
workflows - which most people are taught informally by experience
working in teams. Git is structured in branches: each branch is a string
of versions. You have a main branch (usually called 'master'). The most
conventional workflow is to identify a specific change you want to make
to the code, create a new branch named for that change, work on that
branch until the change is done (may be only one extra version, may be
many), then if you decide to add that change to the code permanently you
merge the branch into master. In general, the only edits you make to the
code on each branch are those strictly relevant to the change you are
making. This ensures that it is easy to find the location of particular
modifications when you go back, and prevents you interfering with work
that may be ongoing in other branches. Each new version should be
dedicated to a specific and nameable change (commits should be
'atomic'). This means that the changelog will accurately reflect what is
changed where, and that you always know which point to go back to when
something breaks.
You can view the changes made using the commands 'git log' or 'git reflog show',
</p>

<p>
For complex changes you'll often recurse: you might make a branch for a
feature 'generate-bananas' and then branch off that for
'calculate-curvature', merge 'calculate-curvature' into
'generate-bananas' and then do the same for 'create-skin' before merging
'generate-bananas' back into master.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-code-review" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="code-review">Code Review</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-code-review">
<p>
Code review is arguably the most important on this list: because beyond
improving the quality of your code, it also makes a really big
difference to improving your programming skill and how you apply the
other principles. Reviewing other people's code is also really helpful
for improving your own code. In a team, code review is usually done with
a git workflow, at the points where changes are merged: in order to
merge into master, colleagues need to review the changes on your branch
and approve them. People learn about new libraries, conventions,
readability, and language features through review, and since you act on
the feedback in the review by implementing it in your own code it
actually sticks in your memory more than if you read about it somwhere.
The general rule of thumb is three pairs of eyes on each line of code.
Code review usually takes the form of the reviewer reading over the
changes, noting issues and suggesting modifications, which the one who
made the changes then either implements or discusses. This may go for a
few rounds, early on it takes a lot of time because there is a lot to
improve, but before long it is less of an issue. Sometimes you may spot
an issue, but not have a clear idea of a solution. In this case, it is
important to still note it down. Someone else may have a solution, or an
idea will come to you later.
</p>

<p>
There is no real replacement for engaging in code review with other
experienced programmers, but when working solo you can still get some of
the benefits by self-review. After writing changes, give it some time
(maybe just sleep on it, maybe come back to it next week), and then
review them, edit, and merge.
</p>

<p>
Contributing to open source software can be a good way to get practice
with code review, as well as seeing some of the other practices here in
action.
</p>

<p>
It's unfortunate that this practice depends to some degree on the
environment around you to work. Part of my motivation to become a
professor is to establish a convention of code review between scientists
in a lab: because it is really very important for ones growth as a
programmer and the quality of ones output. There is also an aspect of
scientific integrity to this: peer review usually does not include
review of the code used for a study, even in computational fields. This
is, in the most technical terms, bonkers.
</p>

<p>
The code is as important as any derivation,
and it also provides the most precise picture of what was done for the
study (there have been several studies that did not make sense to me
until I read the code, others where unaddressed assumptions were hidden
in the code which should have been acknowledged in the paper).
</p>

<p>
If you have colleagues who are doing similar work in the same language,
consider suggesting mutually reviewing one another's code using
something like github, gitlab, or bitbucket (I'll expand on this in a
later section).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-automated-testing" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="automated-testing">Automated testing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-automated-testing">
<p>
There is a lot of controversy about which kind of automated testing one
should do at which times: Unit testing (testing individual bits of
code), integration testing (testing that different bits of code work
well together), acceptance testing (testing that the behavior of the
application as a whole satisfies requirements), implementation testing
(testing for implementation-specific bugs and edge cases), test-then
code, or code-then-test? There is no controversy about whether or not
you should perform automated testing. You should do so in at least some
form. It's important to write tests not just to see that your code is
working now for the particular case you're concerned about (that could
be accomplished with manual testing, after all): but that changes you
make now don't break functionality you implemented previously.
The best part of this is that with your tests in place you can go back
to refactor and improve old code without fear of breaking anything.
I can straight up feel the difference in stress levels when refactoring
tested v.s. untested code.
</p>

<p>
It is
also a good idea to write tests reproducing any bugs you run into, to
check that you don't reintroduce them down the line (which happens way
more often than you would ever expect). The chapter on testing from
'Abstraction and specification in program development' by Barbara Liskov
provides a really useful overview of the most important elements of
testing, though it is focused on unit testing. Each language will have
frameworks for writing and running automated tests: for python I
personally really like pytest. I haven't used R in a long time, but when
I started looking I found this page:
<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/11/automated-testing-with-testthat-in-practice/">https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/11/automated-testing-with-testthat-in-practice/</a>
</p>

<p>
Depending on how you do it, testing can also help improve the design of
your program. Code that is easy to test is often easy to use as well.
I like to write tests upfront to specify what the code should do
before I write the code itself: speaking of&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-abstraction-and-specification" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="abstraction-and-specification">Abstraction and Specification</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-abstraction-and-specification">
<p>
When designing a piece of code - whether we're talking a single
function, a class, a module, a script or the complete software, the
design should be independent of the implementation. The point here is
that you need to define in specific terms what your piece of code needs
to do before you think about how it will do it. This is the premise for
"Abstraction and Specification in program development" by Barbara Liskov and Jon Guttag, mentioned in
"Smalltalk, objects, and design" by Chamond Liu, and when applied to whole software
products it is the subject of an extended rant
called "The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High Tech Products Drive
Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity" by Alan Cooper. Though Cooper
 states that engineers should have no influence over a
program's design (which should be left to specialized designers), the
principles he mentions crop up time and again at a more fine-grained
level in software engineering. A phrase of his that I like is: Pretend
its magic. Before you write any code, pretend your code is magic and
specify what you would like it to do. Once you implement the design it
may turn out to be infeasible, and at this point you revise your design.
Doing this the other way around: implementing first and then designing
around whatever program you made, almost always results in programs
which are awkward to use, and counterintuitively, overcomplicated.
The great thing about upfront specification is that it forces you
to ignore the changeable implementation details of your code.
This way, the usage you define for this piece of code is less likely
to need to change if the implementation changes (e.g.
if you refactor to make it more efficient).
This prevents changes to one piece of code from ballooning out into
the code which uses that piece.
If the usage of this unit of code changes when you change it's implementation,
you then also have to change every line of code which makes use of the unit.
</p>

<p>
It is often difficult to know upfront what exactly you would like
your piece of code to do. One strategy to make this easier is to write
a simple prototype of the code in question and examine its usage critically.
This can give you an idea of what you would like the program to do;
you can then throw away the prototype (discarding code is normal and often good),
and start over with a well-defined idea.
Another thing which helps is to break down the usage into individual, specific scenarios.
I'll get into a specific strategy for implementing this in the next section.

My first programming instructor, Breanndan, was actually very good in
that he taught most of these practices early on and emphasized their
importance and universality. It's a shame that no one after him did -
because that led to me disregarding them and losing a lot of time to
obscure bugs and confusing variable names. I'll share my own strategy
for implementing the above practices in a straightforward way: mostly
based on the strategy Breanndan taught. It combines Test-driven
development and continuous integration (both popular in Agile
workplaces).
</p>

<p>
Test-driven development:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>write/modify a function signature and a docstring describing what
the function does</li>
<li>write a single test case for the function</li>
<li>write the simplest code needed to pass the test case</li>
<li>refactor the function as needed and repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>
This low-level process combines practices 3 and 4 into one: after an
informal specification of the function (docstring), the tests act to
formally specify its behavior.
</p>

<p>
You put this in a git workflow using a repository host (such as GitHub,
Gitlab, bitbucket, or gerrit). You'll need to set up continuous
integration to run your automated tests, and linting (enforces
consistent style; for python I run pylint, pycodestyle, and pydocstyle).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>you are on the master branch; pull from the remote repository to
ensure it is up to date</li>
<li>identify the feature you want to implement and create a branch named
for that feature</li>
<li>code until that feature is tested and implemented</li>
<li>check that your tests pass and address any errors provided by
linting software or your IDE</li>
<li>push the feature branch to the remote repository</li>
<li>on your repository hosting software, create a pull request :
requesting to merge the feature branch into master</li>
<li>resolve any merge conflicts (changes on your branch that contradict
changes to master that occured after you branched off).</li>
<li>address any failing tests or linting errors</li>
<li>someone uses the repository host's built-in code review tools to
leave comments</li>
<li>respond to comments and implement suggestions</li>
<li>repeat 7-9 until reviewer is satisfied and merge</li>
</ol>

<p>
This combines the version control and code review. By combining this
with the test-driven development you follow all four practices in a
structured and documented way. By breaking down the functionality of
your program into individual features, those features into functions,
those functions into test cases, you simplify the development process.

<h3 id="prototyping">prototyping</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-prototyping">
<p>
Sometimes you don't have a clear picture yet of what you want your
program to do or what its usage is, or sometimes you want some
preliminary results before investing effort into a full program. In
these cases, you may want to make a prototype, and then rewrite it from
scratch when you have a clearer idea of what you want it to do.
</p>

<p>
When prototyping, the prototype will probably be a little more
complicated than you anticipate, so it is still good to follow these
principles to an extent; but you can usually skip exhaustive unit
testing (just test the main behaviors of the program and the most
complex bits), self-review will probably suffice, and your version
history can be a straight line. You'll have to intuit based on the
circumstances to which extent to apply these practices, but it should
always be nonzero, and it is better to err on the side of clean
code that takes you twice as long as it needed to, than the stressful
nightmare of bad code which takes between 0.75 and 300 times as long as
it needed to.
</p>

<p>
Avoid building on a prototype: rewrite it rigorously first. The
shortcuts taken early on will cost far more time later than the time it
takes to rewrite.
</p>

<p>
And sometimes, you accidentally make a messy prototype while trying to
make the real deal. Sometimes, it is worthwhile to restart with lessons
learned even if you weren't intending to at first. (saved me a lot of
headache on my masters thesis).

General principles to keep in mind when writing, reviewing, or editing

 worth noting and addressing if possible. There are many more
than this, listing them all would be overwhelming: these are the most
basic and important ones.

Wherever you repeat a chunk of code you have used elsewhere, this is a

and use that function wherever you repeated the code.

<h3 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-single-responsibility-principle">
<p>
Each piece of code (usually function, sometimes class/object or module)
should have a single, clearly defined thing it does. Avoid units with
multiple responsibilities, or responsibilities which overlap.

<h3 id="use-a-consistent-style">Use a consistent style</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-use-a-consistent-style">
<p>
Your code is easier to read when it is consistent. This includes naming
conventions, indentation, whether you put spaces before and after
operators, etc.
</p>

<p>
A common naming convention is the use nouns for variables, and verbs for
functions. A less conventional but not uncommon one uses nouns for
variables and pure functions (functions which return a value without
side effects), and verbs for functions with a side effect.
</p>

<p>
There are also programs that will help to ensure your style is consistent.
These are called linters: and will mention any style violations to you.
The first few
times you go through your code to conform to coding standards it will
probably consume a lot of time and be really annoying, but before long
you get used to coding within these standards. Most IDEs can also be
configured to warn you about style violations in real-time.

<h3 id="approximate-natural-language">Approximate Natural Language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-approximate-natural-language">
<p>
As a rule of thumb, the closer your code looks to natural language, the
easier it is to read and understand. For example, people often make the
mistake of naming variables things like: f32<sub>x</sub><sub>arr</sub>, which contains some
information about what the variable is, but not what it represents.
<code>f32_x_arr += f32_vx_arr</code> is confusing, while
<code>x_positions += x_velocities</code> can be skimmed to understand what this
means in the application domain. Another common case where this applies
is when there is some complicated set of operations that could be given
an intuitive name as a function. For example
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd808cf4">
for item in inventory:
    if item.nutritional_content &gt; 0 and (item.isliquid and item.viscosity &lt; 1 or item.hardness &gt; TOOTH_HARDNESS):
        self.mouth.angle += 25
        #(and so on, you get the picture)
</pre>

<p>
could be
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgdc79707">
for item in inventory:
    if _is_edible(item):
        self.eat(item)
</pre>

<p>
by just defining some well-named functions.

<p>
When writing code, it is easy to get sidetracked early with making it as
efficient as possible. This often results in more complicated code and a
lot of additional effort with very few performance benefits. Our
intuitiions for performance are usually not very good - and often depend
on the usage of the program. It is best not to think too much about
performance at first. Once your program is running, if it is slower than
you would like, you can use a profiler tool to empirically identify the
most important bottlenecks and refactor those specifically.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-keep-it-simple-stupid">
<p>
Less code is better than more code, and an embarassingly simple program
that gets the job done is way better than an impressively complicated
program that does the same job <i>even if the former took longer to
develop</i>. It's easier to understand, easier to improve on,
easier to prevent and spot bugs in, and just plain better for your sanity.

<h3 id="honorable-mention-modularity">Honorable mention: modularity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-honorable-mention-modularity">
<p>
Honorable mention because it's really a theme running through all the
other principles: your code should be broken into chunks that operate
mostly independently of one another, minimizing the risk that changes in
one chunk break a different one. Software is a diseconomy of scale: the
effort to make a program scales superlinearly with its size. By turning
one program into a collection of smaller ones, you address this scaling.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-commenting-code">
<p>
Besides docstrings (which are documentation, rather than comments),
comments should be the exception rather than the rule. It's a bit of a
meme for novices to complain about uncommented code. In general, if code
requires comments to be clear, the code is poorly written. Sometimes a
comment is needed to clarify <i>why</i> something is done a particular way,
but if a comment clarifies <i>what</i> the code does, it is a sign that code
could be written more clearly.
