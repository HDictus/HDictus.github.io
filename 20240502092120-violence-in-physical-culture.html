In a gym in Amsterdam, a Krav Maga instructor grimly tells us how to deal with someone who places their hand on your shoulder from behind.
You pinch their fingers between your ear and shoulder and violently turn to face them, breaking their fingers.
Then, of course, you batter their groin with knees.
And the first timers are left wondering: in what situation is that actually the appropriate response?
</p>

<p>
Of course, we practiced it very slowly and without any kind of resistance or reaction from the "assailant".
But there was a lot of tough talk, a very serious atmosphere.
It felt raw, real, even though the violence was practically symbolic.
</p>

<p>
I swear this essay isn't just me shitting on krav maga, there's a point.
This way of approaching self defense is neither unique to Krav Maga nor universal to it.
It is both pervasive enough and controversial enough in a variety of martial arts communities to be <a href="https://youtu.be/3CGMWlXosp4?si=u89Bwgyx5KcWmPmZ&amp;t=115">be the subject of parody</a>.
</p>

<p>
I see this as being a symptom of a widespread attitude that views callous approaches to tackling problems as inherently more pragmatic than compassionate ones.
Martial arts training is one of many cases in which the opposite is true.
</p>


<div id="outline-container-org193429b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org193429b">The failings of brutality</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org193429b">
<p>
What sets Krav Maga apart from most approaches to fighting is the emphasis on building aggression over technique, doing damage over maintaining control.
No draftee heading off to war has time to master martial arts, you just need to make sure they fight hard.
</p>

<p>
The branded krav maga taught to civilians does tend to have some technical cohesion, mediated by the organizations that sell it.
There are specific techniques and principles, but the most consistent one seems to be this: do stuff you aren't allowed to do in combat sports.
Hit the groin (a lot), gouge eyes, snap fingers.
Technique doesn't matter: what matters is that you're meaner than the other guy.
</p>

<p>
In online communities dedicated to combat sports Krav Maga has been the target of ridicule ever since it rose to widespread popularity.
In Mixed Martial Arts, the examples I have seen of Krav Maga fighters involved the Krav fighter being handily controlled by the combat athlete.
They never even recieved an opening where they could have used a groin kick or eye poke had they been allowed.
If you want to gouge someone's eyes, you need to get past their defenses to touch their face.
If you want to kick someone's groin, you need to manage the distance and set it up just like any other kick.
So you need a certain parity of skill if you're going to use these techniques.
And conversely, if you have a sufficient skill advantage, you don't need to use them.
You cannot build skill by role-playing maiming.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc4b62a7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc4b62a7">The violent power of compassion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc4b62a7">
<p>
What is the alternative?
What does build that kind of skill?
The exact opposite: focus on techniques that are safe to apply and apply them for real.
When Judo was emerging as a martial art this was the philosophy that set it apart from other Jujitsu styles.
Nowadays in competitions like mixed martial arts, where it is permitted to violently wrench an opponet's joints, those who prevail are not those who spend time practicing this, like in pre-judo jujitsu.
Those with the greatest success are those who focus on techniques with a lower risk for injury - especially wrestling and brazilian jiu jitsu, but also other combat sports like boxing, muay thai and indeed Judo.
</p>


<p>
The advantage to an individual fighter isn't just that they get injured less, but that their training partners get injured less.
In BJJ circles it is a saying that the more you help your training partners improve, the more they will have to teach you.
Martial arts training has an inherently cooperative element, which helps prepare people for the eventual competitive aspects.
Which brings me to another point about how a less aggressive approach to preparing for violence is actually more effective.
</p>

<p>
I do not want to overemphasize the importance of training intensity and realism - facing off against a partner who is fighting hard to best you is a crucial part of training, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd-IyHiu0ug">growing consensus</a> is that this should not be most of your training.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoRASZiPFc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoRASZiPFc</a>
</p>

<p>
Any martial arts forum will furnish you with complaints of people going 'too hard' in sparring practice or focusing on "winning" over learning.
Most of your sparring should be at substantially less than full force, as this lowers the risk of injury.
Futhermore, it is important to adjust to the level of your partner and not resist them so hard that they are completely shut down.
To keep both parties learning and challenged, both parties need to have opportunities to work, to attack, defend, and counter.
I once recieved advice to seek out the tallest, most skilled person in the school to spar with for kickboxing - as they're the greatest challenge and therefore the best learning experience.
It turns out that being so outclassed that everything you do ends in failure is not actually conducive to learning.
On the contrary, it is so bad for learning that it is used as an experimental protocol for inducing a <a href="20230301083111-serotonin_and_heplessness.html#ID-02504069-e1e7-43c8-a746-43ed27a2f807">helpless state in which learning ability is impaired</a>.
</p>

<p>
So the central theme is not so much resistance and intensity (although that is important), but freedom of play and safety from injury.
Where the high-brow pacifistic musings of some (especially buddhism-influenced) martial arts and the actual development of combative skill meet is here: to develop a group of students into capable fighters they must learn to exercise kindness towards one another.
</p>

<p>
"As long as we coexist, each member of society and the groups organised
within must function in harmony and cooperation with the others.
Nothing is more important than living prosperously together. If everyone
acts with the spirit of mutual cooperation, each person’s work benefits
not only himself, but also others, and attaining this together will bring
mutual happiness. [&#x2026;] This great principle of harmony and
cooperation is, in other words, the concept of Jita-Kyoei, or mutual
prosperity for self and others."

<h2 id="org06517a0">Evidence-based self defense</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org06517a0">
<p>
When I went looking for <a href="20240515094838-self_def_bibliography.html#ID-5d38c8d0-8c5e-4dee-8f04-5427a806c285">peer-reviewed articles on self defense</a> I found that all the evidence based literature was focused on women's self defense.
Although <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178907000766?casa_token=3DvBAIeZ9IAAAAAA:tErJw-u3458JUwdfI7TstyKi1o3AmYhoBR5tDdwDyZvW7VWZViuVd56kVmz04SPYhC3S9zhQVw">some evidence</a> exists for benefits from a variety of self defense courses, only one approach (as far as I could find) has solid, systematic, controlled data collection backing it up.
This is <a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/soc4.12597?casa_token=a_u-H1-xxVYAAAAA:ep0_5otMwbp3xzbalKCcxyKrLAipUO7e6GXbxdsSSW6q73XMV97u7Jc28FiTUHEY6NK4ds76lq4BUQ">Empowerment self defense</a> (ESD), researched extensively by Jocelyn Hollander.
</p>

<p>
A very interesting aspect of this research, at least reading as a martial artist, is that the physical techniques are the least important aspect of the training.
Rather, much of the education in ESD focuses on the setting, communicating, and enforcing of boundaries, and of understanding one's rights.
Participants in ESD training often report they successfully protect themselves without resorting to violence at all.
Once again, sufficient skill in less violent means reduces the necessity of more violent means.
</p>

<p>
This isn't to say that the physical side of self defense doesn't matter.
Women who fight back physically when assaulted are more likely to get away safely, and have better psychological outcomes even if they fail to.
Women who recieved a physical self defense course are more likely to fight back, and more likely to do so successfully.
</p>

<p>
Jumping straightaway to the nuclear, groin-destroying, eye-blinding option is not a feature of these self defense systems.
Rather, they offer a range of techniques for interrupting an assault before it comes to that.
So, why not jump to the nuclear option? If a stranger ambushes you and attempts to rape you, don't you have every right, and every reason to jump straight to this?
The fact of the matter is that stranger rape is the exception, not the rule when it comes to violence against women.
The vast majority of assaults on women are perpetrated by acquaintances, family, friends, and especially intimate partners.
The use of extreme violence in these situations faces social and psychological barriers.
</p>

<p>
This is also why the non-physical strategies and traits imparted by ESD are so important.
The research shows that when ESD is taught to populations of women they are not just better at protecting themselves - but less likely to be assaulted in the first place.
We need to understand that sexual violence, indeed all violence, is socially and culturally situated and involves aspects of manipulation, coercion, rationalization and justification.
Resistance to these non-physical means of facilitating violence in personal relationships plays an important role in self defense.
</p>

<p>
The ambitions of many martial arts, for example Judo, extend beyond providing physical skills, safety, and physical education to its participants, but also to exert a transformative influence on society.
This is an ambition that ESD shares, and Hollander emphasizes its potential in changing the culture that creates violence against women.
How our fighting arts understand and respond to violence shapes the culture in which violence takes place: so we had best ensure that, like for ESD, our idea of violence and its prevention is based on reality rather than comforting simplistic fantasies.

<div id="outline-container-orga878c30" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga878c30">Our flawed understanding of violence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga878c30">
<p>
In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmsoVFCUN3Q">excellent video essay</a>, Natalie Wynn proposes that violence is not an aberrant behavior engaged in by some deranged individuals, but an intrinsically pleasurable part of human experience.
Morality, empathy, and society impose emotional side-effects on violence that make it not worth our while.
When we are provided with something that disrupts our ability to empathize with the target of violence and gives us a moral and social excuse, for instance if they have wronged us, then violence is fun.
</p>

<p>
If you disagree that violence is intrinsically fun, I suspect that you are not a martial artist, and that your taste in media differs from the mainstream.
More to the point, whatever the underlying psychology the point is that in the right circumstances anyone will gladly engage in acts of violence.
When I looked into the <a href="20240526140107-literature_on_violence.html#ID-9c07c580-4722-4189-97ed-d26c9f6f0a34">peer-reviewed literature</a> that I could find I found support for this view.
</p>

<p>
The important point here is that <b>anyone</b> is capable of enjoying violence in the right circumstances.
Patriarchy furnishes ordinary men with convenient rationalizations and the emotional distance required for violence against women.
Fascism feeds the fear and contempt of an ordinary populace and suppresses their empathy, a recipe for genocide.
</p>

<p>
The naive view that violence is committed by exceptional 'bad people' informs how a lot of people view crime, punishment, and self defense.
Self defense training in most martial arts adopts this view of the aggressor.
"<a href="https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/163874/1/6516ee7b496da.pdf">We do bad things to bad people</a>" was the official motto of the german Deutsche Krav Maga Bund in 2022.
This view is convenient and pleasurable, guiltlessly justifying the fantasy of violence.
</p>

<p>
Beyond interpersonal violence the naive view shapes people's views on institutional and international violence as well.
I'll refer you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smQsfNw_7V4">another of Wynn's video essays</a> for a more thorough version of this argument.
The gist of it is that the idea that Justice is Retribution has been the predominant conception of justice throughout most of human history.
Modern justice systems are nominally based on more modern ideas regarding deterrence of crime and reform of criminals.
The law is nonetheless written, carried out, enforced, and indeed broken by ordinary people whose minds are still stuck in 4000 BC.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="org960b393">Compassion and retribution in criminal justice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org960b393">
<p>
Simplistic views of violence and crime permeate attitudes toward law enforcement and criminal justice.
This easily demonstrated in the united states by examining the discussions surrounding police brutality.
I definitely see signs of it in europe as well, though it seems less widespread and its influence on policy and institutions is mercifully weaker.
</p>

<p>
My home country of the Netherlands has an effective system of policing, <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781003360452-4/netherlands-variations-theme-mawby?context=ubx&amp;refId=5fa4cfda-742f-4364-9ebd-04d3ad35d10b">hisorically focusing on serving communities over punishing offenders</a>.
Our approach to drug addiction similarly focuses on helping, rather than punishing addicts, and the justice system likewise is focused on rehabilitation over punishment.
This works well - the Netherlands is a very safe country and gets steadily safer each year.
Our prisons are so empty we rent them out to other countries.
In the current political climate however there is a push towards more aggressive policing, punitive treatment for addiction, and harsher sentencing.
</p>

<p>
These approaches are <a href="20240728094805-tough_on_crime_doesnt_work.html#ID-33a5d8a0-925e-4c6a-a3f7-f2c640ae7a52">financially expensive, socially costly, and ultimately ineffective</a>.
My objection to this development is not moral, but pragmatic.
Furthermore, I contend that the motivation for these policies is not a desire to reduce crime, but an emotional urge.
It is rooted in the desire to see violence enacted on "the bad people", and rationalized with naive views on who commits crime and why.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2012.631456">Something that seems to be fairly new</a> in approaches to counterterrorism is the idea that war crimes are necessary and inevitable in effective counterterrorism operations.
This likely has a lot to do with how terrorism has changed to make this approach necessary, but I suspect that this also has much to do with rationalizing a violent impulse and using the satisfaction of that impulse for political support, much like the "tough on crime" rhetoric that drives ineffective policing and criminal justice.

When a government harms members of a foreign population through killing civilians, illegaly detaining and torturing suspects, and so on it naturally incurs costs in terms of local support.
I expected to find a lot of resarch into exactly what those costs are, but it turns out to be fairly limited.
It does seem to reduce the willingness of a population to cooperate with counterinsurgency (and conversely, if insurgents kill civilians it increases civilian cooperation with counterinsurgents).
But does it drive recruitment from those populations into the ranks of terrorist organizations?
Does it undermine the overall stability and well-being of the region?
How large is the effect on the economic prospects of people and their ability to provide for themselves without the help of a criminal organization?

Given the gradual escalation of global terror in the middle east paralleling these developments in counterterrorism, I suspect that the long-term efficacy of these tactics is negative.
Like a government militarizing its police to fight crime while it cuts the social programs that truly prevent crime, western governments poured immense resources into destabilizing parts of the middle east, supposedly to combat terrorism.
Analysis of counterterrorism methods, from what I can find, tends to assume a steady supply of willing terrorists and focuses instead on imposing risk on terrorist action or witholding means to terrorist acts.
Granted, if there was no supply of willing terrorists then there would be no terrorism, so assuming that supply exists is indeed reasonable.
Assuming it is unaffected by the counterterrorism measures adopted however, is not.

Perhaps it is more effective, if less viscerally satisfying and politically expedient, to stabilize a belligerent region with prosperity than to destabilize it with violence.

<p>
We see again that a callous short-term solution has been uncritically accepted as the pragmatic option, while evidence-based compassionate approaches exist.
Killing the "bad people" is seen as the obvious solution, even when doing so fuels the mechanisms that turn ordinary people into terrorists.
Geopolitical decision making is driven by dominant attitudes among voters and policy-makers.
Popular, simplistic views on the genesis of violence are once again partly responsible for how governments have chosen to respond to international threats.

Martial arts have immediate effects in the lives of the people that practice them, and broader effects that diffuse into popular culture through engagement with martial sporting events or movies.
I run the risk of overstating the cultural impact of martial arts training by talking about this immediately after discussing global terrorism.
The role of martial arts in cultural perceptions of violence is probably minor, but it is nonetheless extant.
It has the potential to positively shape how we think about violence and crime.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, civilian martial arts should be focused on enriching the lives of the people who practice them rather than simply on imparting hand-to-hand skill.
Community, health, fitness, and fun are all more valuable to your well being than hand-to-hand fighting ability.
Ultimately however, I think it is a mistake to place these goals in opposition to one another.
It isn't a balancing act: the methods that promote optimal development of skill do so by emphasizing community, safety, and fun.
Good martial arts training enriches your life first and foremost.
</p>

<p>
Martial arts are also physical culture, reflecting and shaping how we think about its subject matter: namely violence.
When a martial art is employed professionally, for instance in police or military training, it then embeds its philosophy of violence in the professional institution.
The way we approach violence should be shaped by a realistic understanding of it, not a pseudo-cynical 'good guys vs bad guys' fairy tale.
That starts with remembering the humanity of those who perpetrate violence, and the capacity of all humans to perpetrate it themselves.
