TODO: debating what way of training works better is incredibly pass'e and beside the point. Martial arts provides other far more important things, and can provide them without reinforcing a naive and polarizing philosophy of violence.
</p>

<p>
In a gym in Amsterdam, an instructor grimly tells us how to deal with someone who places their hand on your shoulder from behind.
You pinch their fingers between your ear and shoulder and violently turn to face them, breaking their fingers.
Then, of course, you batter their groin with knees.
And the first timers are left wondering: in what situation is that actually the appropriate response?
</p>

<p>
Of course, we practiced it very slowly and without any kind of resistance or reaction from the "assailant".
But there was a lot of tough talk, a very serious atmosphere.
It felt raw, real, even though the violence was practically symbolic.
</p>

<p>
I swear this essay isn't just me shitting on krav maga, there's a point.
This way of approaching self defense is neither unique to Krav Maga nor universal to it.
It is both pervasive enough and controversial enough in a variety of martial arts communities to be <a href="https://youtu.be/3CGMWlXosp4?si=u89Bwgyx5KcWmPmZ&amp;t=115">be the subject of parody</a>.
</p>

<p>
Part of Krav Maga's marketing is its extensive use by police around the world, especially in Israel and the USA.
Several organizations have noted a similar, and similarly agressive, approach to policing in both countries.
The philosophy of violence embedded in Krav Maga's approach fits very nicely within the aggressive "tough on crime" policing methods popular in both countries.
And perhaps there is no better indictment of this philosophy than the failure of this method of policing in the USA.
The way we practice and portray martial arts reflects, and perhaps reinforces how we approach violence.
I hope to impress on the reader that compassion, not cruelty, is instrumental in effectively coping with violence.
I hope this helps them to transform their approach to martial arts and combat sports.
</p>

<h2 id="org5a25fb4">The failings of brutality</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a25fb4">
<p>
What sets Krav Maga apart from most approaches to fighting is the emphasis on building aggression over technique, doing damage over maintaining control.
No draftee heading off to war has time to master martial arts, you just need to make sure they fight hard.
</p>

<p>
The branded krav maga taught to civilians does tend to have some technical cohesion, mediated by the organizations that sell it.
There are specific techniques and principles, but the most consistent one seems to be this: do stuff you aren't allowed to do in combat sports.
Hit the groin (a lot), gouge eyes, snap fingers.
Technique doesn't matter: what matters is that you're meaner than the other guy.
</p>

<p>
In online communities dedicated to combat sports Krav Maga has been the target of ridicule ever since it rose to widespread popularity.
In Mixed Martial Arts, the examples I have seen of Krav Maga fighters involved the Krav fighter being handily controlled by the combat athlete.
They never even recieved an opening where they could have used a groin kick or eye poke had they been allowed.
If you want to gouge someone's eyes, you need to get past their defenses to touch their face.
If you want to kick someone's groin, you need to manage the distance and set it up just like any other kick.
So you need a certain parity of skill if you're going to use these techniques.
And conversely, if you have a sufficient skill advantage, you don't need to use them.
</p>

<h2 id="orge4731d1">The violent power of compassion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge4731d1">
<p>
What is the alternative?
What does build that kind of skill?
The exact opposite: focus on techniques that are safe to apply and apply them for real.
When Judo was emerging as a martial art this was the philosophy that set it apart from other Jujitsu styles.
Nowadays in competitions like mixed martial arts, where it is permitted to violently wrench an opponet's joints, those who prevail are not those who spend time practicing this, like in pre-judo jujitsu.
Those with the greatest success are those who focus on techniques with a lower risk for injury - especially wrestling and brazilian jiu jitsu, but also other combat sports like boxing, muay thai and indeed Judo.
</p>


<p>
The advantage to an individual fighter isn't just that they get injured less, but that their training partners get injured less.
In BJJ circles it is a saying that the more you help your training partners improve, the more they will have to teach you.
Martial arts training has an inherently cooperative element, which helps prepare people for the eventual competitive aspects.
Which brings me to another point about how a less aggressive approach to preparing for violence is actually more effective.
</p>

<p>
I do not want to overemphasize the importance of training intensity and realism - facing off against a partner who is fighting hard to best you is a crucial part of training, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd-IyHiu0ug">growing consensus</a> is that this should not be most of your training.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoRASZiPFc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoRASZiPFc</a>
</p>

<p>
Any martial arts forum will furnish you with complaints of people going 'too hard' in sparring practice or focusing on "winning" over learning.
Most of your sparring should be at substantially less than full speed and less than full force, as this lowers the risk of injury.
Futhermore, it is important to adjust to the level of your partner and not resist them so hard that they are completely shut down.
To keep both parties learning and challenged, both parties need to have opportunities to work, to attack, defend, and counter.
I once recieved advice to seek out the tallest, most skilled person in the school to spar with for kickboxing - as they're the greatest challenge and therefore the best learning experience.
It turns out that being so outclassed that everything you do ends in failure is not actually conducive to learning.
On the contrary, it is so bad for learning that it is used as an experimental protocol for inducing a <a href="20230301083111-serotonin_and_heplessness.html#ID-02504069-e1e7-43c8-a746-43ed27a2f807">helpless state in which learning ability is impaired</a>.
</p>

<p>
So the central theme is not so much resistance and intensity (although that is important), but freedom of play and safety from injury.
Where the high-brow pacifistic musings of some (especially buddhism-influenced) martial arts and the actual development of combative skill meet is here: to develop a group of students into capable fighters they must learn to exercise kindness towards one another.
</p>

<p>
"As long as we coexist, each member of society and the groups organised
within must function in harmony and cooperation with the others.
Nothing is more important than living prosperously together. If everyone
acts with the spirit of mutual cooperation, each person’s work benefits
not only himself, but also others, and attaining this together will bring
mutual happiness. [&#x2026;] This great principle of harmony and
cooperation is, in other words, the concept of Jita-Kyoei, or mutual
prosperity for self and others."

<h2 id="orgc64d945">Evidence-based self defense</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc64d945">
<p>
When I went looking for <a href="20240515094838-self_def_bibliography.html#ID-5d38c8d0-8c5e-4dee-8f04-5427a806c285">peer-reviewed articles on self defense</a> I found that all the evidence based literature was focused on women's self defense.
Although <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178907000766?casa_token=3DvBAIeZ9IAAAAAA:tErJw-u3458JUwdfI7TstyKi1o3AmYhoBR5tDdwDyZvW7VWZViuVd56kVmz04SPYhC3S9zhQVw">some evidence</a> exists for benefits from a variety of self defense courses, only one approach (as far as I could find) has solid, systematic, controlled data collection backing it up.
This is <a href="https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/soc4.12597?casa_token=a_u-H1-xxVYAAAAA:ep0_5otMwbp3xzbalKCcxyKrLAipUO7e6GXbxdsSSW6q73XMV97u7Jc28FiTUHEY6NK4ds76lq4BUQ">Empowerment self defense</a> (ESD), researched extensively by Jocelyn Hollander.
</p>

<p>
A very interesting aspect of this research, at least reading as a martial artist, is that the physical techniques are the least important aspect of the training.
Rather, much of the education in ESD focuses on the setting, communicating, and enforcing of boundaries, and of understanding one's rights.
Once again, sufficient skill in less violent means reduces the necessity of more violent means.
</p>

<p>
This isn't to say that the physical side of self defense doesn't matter.
Women who fight back physically when assaulted are more likely to get away safely, and have better psychological outcomes even if they fail to.
Women who recieved a physical self defense course are more likely to fight back, and more likely to do so successfully.
</p>

<p>
Jumping straightaway to the nuclear, groin-destroying, eye-blinding option is not a feature of these self defense systems.
Rather, they offer a range of techniques for interrupting an assault before it comes to that.
So, why not jump to the nuclear option? If a stranger ambushes you and attempts to rape you, don't you have every right, and every reason to jump straight to this?
The fact of the matter is that stranger rape is the exception, not the rule when it comes to violence against women.
The vast majority of sexual assaults are perpetrated by acquaintances, family, friends, and especially intimate partners.
The use of extreme violence in these situations faces social and psychological barriers.
</p>

<p>
This is also why the non-physical strategies and traits imparted by ESD are so important.
The research shows that when ESD is taught to populations of women they are not just better at protecting themselves - but less likely to be assaulted in the first place.
We need to understand that sexual violence, indeed all violence, is socially and culturally situated and involves aspects of manipulation, coercion, rationalization and justification.
Resistance to these non-physical means of facilitating violence in personal relationships plays an important role.
</p>

<p>
The ambitions of many martial arts, for example Judo, extend beyond providing physical skills, safety, and physical education to its participants, but also to exert a transformative influence on society.
This is an ambition that ESD shares, and Hollander emphasizes its potential in changing the culture that creates violence against women.
How our fighting arts understand and respond to violence shapes the culture in which violence takes place: so we had best ensure that, like for ESD, our idea of violence and its prevention is based on reality rather than comforting simplistic fantasies.

<div id="outline-container-org1dbec73" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1dbec73">Our flawed understanding of violence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1dbec73">
<p>
In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmsoVFCUN3Q">excellent video essay</a>, Natalie Wynn proposes that violence is not an aberrant behavior engaged in by some deranged individuals, but an intrinsically pleasurable part of human experience.
Morality, empathy, and society impose emotional side-effects on violence that make it not worth our while.
When we are provided with something that disrupts our ability to empathize with the target of violence and gives us a moral and social excuse, for instance if they have wronged us, then violence is fun.
</p>

<p>
If you disagree that violence is intrinsically fun, I suspect that you are not a martial artist, and that your taste in media differs from the mainstream.
More to the point, when I looked into the <a href="20240526140107-literature_on_violence.html#ID-9c07c580-4722-4189-97ed-d26c9f6f0a34">peer-reviewed literature</a> for this post, I found a lot of support for this view.
</p>


<p>
The important point here is that <b>anyone</b> is capable of enjoying violence in the right circumstances.
Patriarchy furnishes ordinary men with convenient rationalizations and the emotional distance required for violence against women.
Fascism feeds the fear and contempt of an ordinary populace and suppresses their empathy, a recipe for genocide.
</p>

<p>
The naive view that violence is committed by exceptional 'bad people' informs how a lot of people view crime, punishment, and self defense.
Self defense training in the vein of most Krav Maga, indeed most martial arts adopts this view of the aggressor.
This view is convenient and pleasurable, guiltlessly justifying the fantasy of extreme violence.
As Wynn points out, nothing is better at removing our inhibitions on enjoying violence than revenge.
</p>

<p>
Beyond interpersonal violence the naive view shapes people's views on institutional and international violence as well.
I'll refer you to another of Wynn's video essays for a more thorough version of this argument.
The gist of it is that the idea that Justice is Retribution has been the predominant conception of justice throughout most human societies.
Modern justice systems are nominally based on more modern ideas regarding deterrence of crime and reform of criminals.
But the law is written, carried out, enforced, and indeed broken by ordinary people whose minds are still stuck in 4000 BC.

TODO: I feel I'm not really that well informed on this topic atm. I should either do some more reading or move it to the pit for later evaluation.
</p>

<p>
Violent crime isn't something that spontaneously generates at a fixed rate and has to be continuously dealt with.
It can be prevented - NOT by aggressive monitoring and policing, but by addressing the underlying reasons for it.

Aggressive, "tough on crime" policing methods are arguably another manifestation of our drive to retribution.
When it comes to the overtly stated goal of protecting people from violent crime they are not only ineffective, but counterproductive.
These methods aim to reduce crime through instilling fear.
Fearful people do stupid - and violent - things.
</p>

<p>
An alternative method for policing focuses on instilling trust rather than fear.
Community policing focuses on socially integrating police into the communities they are meant to protect.
These methods focus on addressing people's real needs for safety over their imagined need for retribution.
Indeed, the lack of trust in local authorities can be a potent catalyst for violence.

There is good evidence that when it comes to incarceration, more humane methods are better at preventing recidivism.

More radically, there is a strong argument to be made that pulling people out of their communities and keeping them from the opportunity to build a career is not the best way to prevent their future criminality.
Alternatives to incarceration, such as house arrest or monitoring, allow people to maintain relatiely normal lives while undergoing rehabilitation.
Restorative justice is an approach in which offenders are (in conference with victims) allowed to take steps to right their wrongs and thereby reduce or evade incarcercation.
The evidence that it is more effective than punitive justice at preventing recidivism is strong.

All this is to give examples of ways in which an intuitive, viscerally satisfying, cynically psuedo-pragmatic strategy of cruelty towards wrongdoing is counterproductive.
A compassionate and rational strategy, when exercised by an agent with the power to implement it successfully, is imennsely more effective.

Krav Maga are often marketed to police, with its use as a military combatives program billed as a positive.
The naive 'do bad things to bad people' rationale of its methods are incompatible not just with developing hand-to-hand skill, but with effective policing and criminal justice.

Something that seems to be fairly new (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2012.631456">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2012.631456</a>) in approaches to counterterrorism is the idea that war crimes are necessary and inevitable in effective counterterrorism operations.
This likely has a lot to do with how terrorism has changed to make this approach necessary, but I suspect that this also has much to do with rationalizing a violent impulse and using the satisfaction of that impulse for political support, much like the "tough on crime" rhetoric of ineffectual politicians.
</p>

<p>
When a government harms members of a foreign population through killing civilians, illegaly detaining and torturing suspects, and so on it naturally incurs costs.
I expected to find a lot of resarch into exactly what those costs are, but it turns out to be fairly limited.
It does seem to reduce the willingness of a population to cooperate with counterinsurgency (and conversely, if insurgents kill civilians it increases civilian cooperation with counterinsurgents).
But does it drive recruitment from those populations into the ranks of terrorist organizations?
Does it undermine the overall stability and well-being of the region?
How large is the effect on the economic prospects of people and their ability to provide for themselves without the help of a criminal organization?
We do not know, leaving the efficacy of these aggressive methods dubious. <a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1016/S1572-8323(08)07018-5">https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1016/S1572-8323(08)07018-5</a>
</p>

<p>
If we don't know just how badly high-collateral tactics backfire, how can we possibly justify using them over more humane alternatives?
Analysis of counterterrorism methods, from what I can find, tends to assume a steady supply of willing terrorists and focuses instead on imposing risk on terrorist action or witholding means to terrorist acts.
Granted, if there was no supply of willing terrorists then there would be no terrorism, so assuming that supply exists is indeed reasonable.
Assuming it is unaffected by the counterterrorism measures adopted however, is not.
Everyone is capable of violence, but most people do not commit violent acts.
Once again we see a naive view of violence as the ineviable outcome of immutibly violent people is used to justify a violent response.
</p>

<p>
The economic blockade of gaza, for instance, was intended to reduce the ability of Hamas to mount terrorist attacks.
While it may have reduced their means to do so, it arguably also backed the palestinian people in Gaza into a corner, strengthening animosity to Israel and support for Hamas.
Repression of aggrieved populations as a means of defending oneself against them fails to address the root of the threat: the grievance.
Countering terrorism in the long term may have more to do with addressing the needs of the populations that are the sources of recruits than with killing terrorists.
I believe that it is more effective, if less viscerally satisfying and politically expedient, to stabilize a belligerent region with prosperity and trust than to destabilize it with violence.

<p>
Violence, besides being satisfying, can give us a sense of control.
When animals are exposed to uncontrollable, unpredictable pain this has debilitiating psychological effects far beyond that of predictable and controllable pain.
Giving an animal a smaller animal to beat up partially alleviates this effect.
</p>

<p>
This sense of control is an illusion - the animal has gained no greater influence over their unfortunate situation.
The violence here is not an expression of power but of powerlessness.
A desparate, short-sighted grasp for agency.
</p>

<p>
If you are physically threatened and you do not have the advantage of fighting skill, aiming just to do damage wherever you can is likely your best strategy.
You do not need to overcome your assailant - only convince them of the credible possibility that they may get injured, making the confrontation not worth their while.
If you have years of experience applying safer techniques at full resistance, you are probably going to have more success using them than an eye gouge you have never done for real.
The inflicting of injury on the other party is an effective short-term solution to your present powerlessness.
And conversely the overcoming of your assailant without injury is a consequence and expression of your mastery and power.
Given that most civilian acts of violence are between people who know each other and share a community, this outcome is often also socially and legally preferable.
</p>

<p>
We have a tendency, at least in the cultures I am familair with, to associate kindness with weakness and sentimentality and callousness with pragmatism and strength.
This tendency forms how we tend to think personally, socially, and poliically.
Poor martial arts training that fails to consistently impart fighting skill reinforces this.
Good martial arts training inverts it.
</p>

<p>
The truth is that in many cases compassion is not a surrender of power but an expression of it, and a means to it.
Martial arts training is only one of the cases in which this truth is revealed.
Using martial arts as a medium to reveal this truth, and instill a visceral understanding of it is a much more valuable thing than simply teaching people to fight well.
Although these ideas align well with those expressed by various martial artists throughout history, there remains a lot of work to do in transforming the culture of martial arts to be up-to-date with our present understanding of violent behavior.

<h2 id="orgb390546">something else</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb390546">
<p>
There was something else I wanted to say as well, about the men-focused culture of martial arts, the emphasis on "street fighting" and how that colors our approach to violence.
In most cases of "street fights", they don't really happen unless you've given someone a rationalization for violence against you.
Many forms of violence taught for 'street fighting' just aren't appropriate for this kind of situation.
Combat sports, practiced responsibly and with mutual wellbeing in mind are appropriate for this.
</p>

<p>
And I think it should be distinguished from a truly asymmetric self defense situation in which extremes of violence are justifed.
These are exceedingly rare for most men, but more common for members of vulnerable groups.
Is this where the killer instinct becomes relevant? Where it becomes necessary to dehumanize your attackers to allow yourself to respond with the force necessary?
</p>

<p>
I suppose one way to sum up the fracturing of my thoughts on this is that while a street fight has the goal of controlling the situation with minimal injury to either party, a true self-defense situation has the goal of using the threat of injury as a deterrent.
I think I need to be careful here not to overstate my case. I should not make claims that I cannot back up on the basis of the literature I have encountered.
</p>

<p>
Terrorists aren't born, they're made by circumstances in which their needs are not met and peaceful means of meeting them do not exist.
If you do not have safety or economic opportunity and attribute this to the influence of a foreign power, you have a ready-made rationalization for violence.
And any other belief, no matter how absurd, that justifies the violence you consider necessary becomes very attractive indeed.

like with a soldier going to war, a self-defense student doens't have time to develop mastery
In the case of an assault, going for causing injury over achieving victory is a viable strategy because it acts to deter the aggressor
Rape completion and victim injury as a function of female resistance strategy found that striking was a more effective resistance strategy than wrestling.
</p>


<p>
Maybe my point here is that martial arts training should not be directed at self defense, but at the safe healthy satistfaction of the violent urge, dismantling dehumanizing rationalizations for violence, and developing the skill to make extreme measures unnecessary.
I do regret how focused on self-defense martial arts training is.
Yes! the socia dimension of violence and the distinction between assault and fighting makes it clear that hand-to-hand fighting skill is not that important for self-protection.

Is repression of palestinians and the witholding of resources really an effective means of preventing terrorism in the long term? Or is it a driving force of terror?

Are the extrajudicial killings, such as through drone strikes, common in modern counterterrorism actually productive in dismantling terrorist organizations and ideologies, or does the collateral damage of such strategies radicalize civilians and provide recruits.

It is well known that aggression helps in a fight, up and coming fighters work hard to develop aggression, and to stay clear-headed while aggressive.
I have no doubt that building capacity for aggression is quicker than developing technical skill.
Krav Maga likely fits the purpose it is made for perfectly fine.
I'll even admit that its possible that it is the more effective means of imparting fighting ability to casual hobbyists.
But hand to hand fighting is among the most irrelevant of skills you can develop for the modern world.
Even when it comes to self-defense we see it is so much more than fighting ability, I would go so far as to say fighting ability is the least important part.
Martial arts training has far more important things to offer its practitioners.
Health and fitness are up there, but social connection is important too.
Martial arts training with a strong sportive component places you in compassionate conflict with friends.
And we could stand to stress the message more: conflict does not need to entail cruelty, and in the long run kindness is more powerful than hate.
