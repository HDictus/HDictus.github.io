In a gym in Amsterdam, an instructor grimly tells us how to deal with someone who places their hand on your shoulder from behind.
You pinch their fingers between your ear and shoulder and violently turn to face them, breaking their fingers.
Then, of course, you batter their groin with knees.
And the first timers are left wondering: in what situation is that actually the appropriate response?
</p>

<p>
Of course, we practiced it very slowly and without any kind of resistance or reaction from the "assailant".
But there was a lot of tough talk, a very serious atmosphere.
It felt raw, real, even though the violence was practically symbolic.
</p>

<p>
Krav Maga is marketed as being used extensively by militaries and police forces.
American police are often sent to train alongside israeli police.
Several organizations have noted a similar, and similarly agressive, approach to policing in both countries.
And perhaps there is no better indictment of the paranoia of Krav Maga's philosophy than the failure of this method of policing in the USA.
</p>

<p>
Among these failings of self defense and policing there is a lesson about conflict resolution, martial arts, human relationships, and analogous lessons in international relations.
</p>

<h2 id="org5a25fb4">The failings of brutality</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a25fb4">
<p>
Krav Maga is not actually a specific martial art.
It refers to any hand-to-hand fighting taugh to the israeli military.
In terms of technique, that could be anything from aikido to boxing.
What sets it apart is the emphasis on building agression over technique, doing damage over maintaining control.
No draftee heading off to war has time to master martial arts, you just need to make sure they fight hard.
</p>

<p>
The branded krav maga taught to civilians does tend to have a clear technical throughline: do stuff you aren't allowed to do in combat sports.
Hit the groin (a lot), gouge eyes, snap fingers.
Technique doesn't matter: what matters is that you're meaner than the other guy.
</p>

<p>
In online communities dedicated to combat sports Krav Maga has been the target of ridicule ever since it rose to widespread popularity.
In Mixed Martial Arts, the examples I have seen of Krav Maga fighters involved the Krav fighter being handily controlled by the combat athlete.
They never even recieved an opening where they could have used a groin kick or eye poke had they been allowed.
If you want to gouge someone's eyes, you need to get past their defenses to touch their face.
If you want to kick someone's groin, you need to manage the distance and set it up just like any other kick.
So you need a certain parity of skill if you're going to use these techniques.
And conversely, if you have a sufficient skill advantage, you don't need to use them.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge4731d1">
<p>
What is the alternative?
What does build that kind of skill?
The exact opposite: focus on techniques that are safe to apply and apply them for real.
When Judo (at the time, Kano-ryu Jujitsu) was emerging as a martial art this was the philosophy that set it apart from other Jujitsu styles.
In competitions between Judoka and other Jujitsy-ryu where injurious techniques were permitted it was the group that used them the least that prevailed.
Judoka trained at higher intensity and with less injuries than their contempories, and this is a large part of why it was so successful.
</p>

<p>
The advantage to an individual fighter isn't just that they get injured less, but that their training partners get injured less.
In BJJ circles it is a saying that the more you help your training partners improve, the more they will have to teach you.
Martial arts training has an inherently cooperative element, which helps prepare people for the eventual competitive aspects.
Which brings me to another point about how a less aggressive approach to preparing for violence is actually more effective.
</p>

<p>
I do not want to overemphasize the importance of training intensity and realism - facing off against a partner who is fighting hard to best you is a crucial part of training, but the growing consensus is that this should not be most of your training.
Any martial arts forum will furnish you with complaints of people going 'too hard' in sparring practice or focusing on "winning" over learning.
Most of your sparring should be at substantially less than full speed and less than full force, as this lowers the risk of injury.
Futhermore, it is important to adjust to the level of your partner and not resist them so hard that they are completely shut down.
To keep both parties learning and challenged, both parties need to have opportunities to work, to attack, defend, and counter.
I once recieved advice to seek out the tallest, most skilled person in the school to spar with for kickboxing - as they're the greatest challenge and therefore the best learning experience.
It turns out that being so outclassed that everything you do ends in failure is not actually conducive to learning.
On the contrary, it is so bad for learning that it is used as an experimental protocol for inducing a <a href="20240510115704-learned_helplessness.html#ID-94ac0879-77e6-4b0a-be68-7b0c9de848a6">helpless state in which learning ability is impaired</a>.
</p>

<p>
So the central theme is not so much resistance and intensity (although that is important), but freedom of play and safety from injury.
Where the high-brow pacifistic musings of some (especially buddhism-influenced) martial arts and the actual development of combative skill meet is here: to develop a group of students into capable fighters they must learn to exercise kindness towards one another.

<h2 id="org01c4fd9">The cowardice of cruelty</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01c4fd9">
<p>
I don't wish to imply that people don't have a right to seriously harm others when they defend themselves.
All that is necessary to secure your safety is justified.
Harming the other party only becomes an issue when it is unnecessary or counterproductive.
Of course it will be hard to recognize in the moment where justified self defense ends and retribution begins.
I have no doubt that the retributive impulse is in fact very important when it comes to avoiding victimization.
Accordinly, the law is rightfully lenient with those who overstep when faced with a real threat.
</p>


<p>
The reality and magnitude of that threat is important.
If you are attacked by an unarmed person of a weak and diminuitive stature, say a child, you have no right to seriously injure them no matter how murderous their intent, and no matter how much you dislike them.
The responsibility to avoid harm rests with the party with the upper hand.
The party with control over the situation is the party with the luxury and obligation of deescalation.
</p>

<p>
In "self-defense" oriented combatives circles (like civilian Krav Maga) you tend to see a lot of "tough" talk about all the ways you can maim someone who tries to hurt you.
This is a part of the hard, no-nonsense aesthetic on which these arts sell themselves.
This aggressive, retributive, "hard masculinity" mindeset is fundamentally defensive.
It is rooted in fear, and can only be justified in the context of vulnerability.
Unless everyone genuinely is out to get you, unless you are actually likely to face a potent threat this isn't toughness or courage, it is paranoia.
Someone who actually is strong, capable, and able to keep themselves safe has no need for it.
In such a person, the impulse to cruelty is nothing but cowardice.
</p>

<p>
A reasonable response to this may be: "Wouldn't you rather be prepared in the event that such an attitude is justified?"
Isn't such an eventuality worth preparing for?
In the case of combat in the ring aggression and a focus on maiming techniques may not get you far - but self defense situations are different from an arranged fight.
Discounting for the moment the psycholgical and social costs of hyper-vigilance, I admit the concession that being psychologically prepared to hurt another person can help to protect you in a violent confrontation.
In self defense, unlike in the ring, you don't need to out-fight your agressor, only to make them believe it is more trouble to mess with you than it is worth.
This brings us to a much broader point.
Contrary to the way it is discussed by most practitioners of martial arts (thus far, myself included), hand-to-hand combat is the least important part of self defense.
Women's self defense specifically has been a topic of a small but significant amount of empirical research.
The findings of this research are flattering neither to combat sports nor Krav Maga.
