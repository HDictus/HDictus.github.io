Letter from your pet during covid times.


Dear Hugo


Pet me. Pet me you busybody. I see you staring at that computer. Right now, It isn't making you happy. You know what would? Petting me.
You're at home, I'm rolling around on my back, why is my belly not being rubbed?
One day you'll go to the office often again, and I will miss you. You will wish you had spent more time petting me.

Even when you went on sick leave (poor mental health - probably because you didn't take the time to pet me more!) you got all self-absorbed.
You should have been absorbed in petting me.

Riddles and I are concerned. You bring all these humans around because you're clearly lonely, but you can't pet them now can you?
For your own health, pet me more.
