This is a summary of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763414000645?casa_token=hjmfrl7xFNAAAAAA:pqpy6OWOISqe0qYEieosSEulWSn3shBZBML0Q7igFXlAqepcp6N0ksedC80AXqgSzdf88nJhyg


Paul et al. discuss the application of the [[id:4624e030-0806-41ad-b5fb-17ffc0117692][Deakin/Graeff hypothesis]] to [[id:7bffa60b-22d2-4ac4-a8f8-c7c90ed54cad][panic-disorder]].

They begin by summarizing the symptoms and prevalence of panic disorder, demnstrating the relevance of the research.

Next they discuss a unique feature of panic disorder in depth: namely that in those with PD, but not in healthy people, panic attacks can be chemically induced.



Takeaways
 - Panic disorder can be studied by chemically inducing panic attacks - which works on those with the disorder, not those without it
   CO2, CCK-4, yohimbine, sodium bicarbonate, isoproterenol hydrochloride, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, m-CPP, fenfluramine, 
 - SSRIs prevent this
 - Ley's suffocation theory of panic disorder states that PD is a consequence of respiratory issues: supported by the action of CO2 and lactate
 - Klein's false suffocation alarm theory states that it is a malfunctioning of the suffocation alarm system
 - ventrolateral [[id:1d8dc1d9-05f9-4c92-86b4-aa6770ec29fc][dorsal raphe nucleus]] and ventrolateral [[id:7052fdd9-a0e5-47b5-bcc3-b5df5403ec29][periaqueductal gray]] inhibit panic-like responses in the dorsal PAG
 - chronic (not administration of SSRIs potentiates the panic-alleviating effects of serotonin
