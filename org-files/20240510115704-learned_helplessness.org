#+title: learned-helplessness

Learned helplessness is a psychological concept often used as a model for depression.

When an animal is exposed to an unpleasant stimulus and unable to escape it, it goes into a passive state.
Furthermore, when the animal is placed in a different context and exposed to a different unpleasant stimulus it will generally not even attempt to escape it, even when the opportunity presents itself.
