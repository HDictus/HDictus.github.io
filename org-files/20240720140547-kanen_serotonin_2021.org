#+title: kanen-serotonin-2021

* Goal
To determine the relevance of serotoninergic signaling for learning and cognitive flexibility.
Assessing the effects of serotonin depletion on reversal learning.

* Method

Kanen et al. compared groups of people with and without [[id:a940a525-7f62-4c5f-b759-d2da9b8fb4f6][serotonin-depletion]] in two [[id:a13dcc9a-91d5-46a1-aa2b-4c960626f1f7][reversal-learning]] tasks.
The first was an [[id:d25b440e-0e19-463c-a0f4-e1c7d66f744b][operant-condiditioning]] task, and the second a [[id:622a4cea-3d99-48aa-a50a-9df682f4a0fa][pavlovian-conditioning]] task.

* Results

The authors found that depleted groups performed substantially worse on the reversal phase.
Additionally, they found that depleted groups performed better on operant conditioning.
