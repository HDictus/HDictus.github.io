#+title: tough-on-crime-doesnt-work


This is a collecton of scholarly articles on policing and criminal justice.
To be completely honest and transparent, most of these I've only read the abstract or just skimmed them.
The consensus that comes from this is so overwhelming however, that I find it hard to imagine the details will change the overall conclusion.
