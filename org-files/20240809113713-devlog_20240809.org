I've fiddled with the movement a bit, it is ok now.
Next I think I'll add the stun mechanic.
I'm not sure how this should interact with striking knockbacke xactly.
Currently, luring an enemy to a log and striking them is a very strong strategy.
I should make tripping dependent on both knock back and offbalance.



A thought I had that I don't want to lose:
I should make it that when the spearman's spear is at the player's heart, that is the dash distance.
This way, the player cannot simply stand outside the spearman's range and dash in, but can dash-lift if they bait the spearman into moving forwards.
It is also important then, that the spearman moves to the right distance.
However, this interferes with the tripping mechanic I had in mind for them.
It can be that they sprint through when at a long distance, and walk upto when at a mid distance.
