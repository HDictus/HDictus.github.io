Frick et al. examine [[id:a13dcc9a-91d5-46a1-aa2b-4c960626f1f7][reversal-learning]] under the effects of various serotoninergic medications.

They find that
 - 10 mg/kg fluoxetine (reuptake inhibitor) impairs acquisition and improves reversal.
 - 10 mg/kg tianepentine (reuptake enhancer) improved acquisition and impaired reversal
 - 10 mg/kg busprione (5HT1A agonist) impaired acquisiion, no effect on reversal
 - 1 mg/kg risperidone (5HT2A antagonist) impaired acquisition and improved reversal
 - 2 mg/kg ondansetron (5HT3 antagonist) impaired acquisition and improved reversal
