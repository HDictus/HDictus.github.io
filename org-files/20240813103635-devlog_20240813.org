I'm adding the stun mechanic now.
I got it partly working last night, but forgot to log it.
Still, there is a lot to do.
I've made the animation, but I have at present forgotten how to export it with gimp.
Looking online, it seems I may be helped by the tilemancer extension.

Ok, I managed.

I now have a working stun system.
Before it can really be put to use however, I'm realizing I need to rework posture.
That will be what I do next.

Additionally, this stun system really needs some juice, and it's not the only thing that needs it.
I need some animations or something for the health bars that also make it clearer what's going on.
Playing around with the sprinting as it stands as well, I think I need to tweak that too.
