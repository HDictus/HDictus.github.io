So I've got the posture system refactored and the stun system working... I thought.

I'm tweaking some things and playing around with it and I seem to be discovering a lot of bugs.
I'm going to revert my current changes and work on them one by one.


The first bug is that stunned enemies will drift without any damping.
 - resolved

Second, the player's striking feels oddly unresponsive.
The number of strikes doesn't seem to match the number of clicks, and they seem to go through awfully late a lot of the time.
This had a number of causes in the overcomplicated controller code.

It is greatly improved by reducing the wind-down of the attacks and making the combo only count up while the player isn't winding down.
I'm still not super comfortable with where it is, but it does feel a lot smoother.
