I'm flying today. Decided to program a bit at the airport.
Always puts me in a gamedev mood.

Let's see, we were in the process of reworking the ai.

some tests are still failing.
I wonder if it's brittleness, or if things genuinely aren't working?

It was a mix of both. I believe I've addressed the brittleness.

The last test seems to be more something that has broken in the striking (and also rendering?) logic for some reason. time to get to the bottom of it.
