Haven't worked on it for a while.
Luckily I have failing tests to guide me.

The test for diagonal movement has broken - how unexpected!

A test related to shoving is crashing, where target is not specified, "throw_behind" isn't working.

The first should be easy to resolve, let's start there.
It seems it was just that the movement has been made a little more floaty, so more time was needed to adjust velocity for the test.

This was a case of test brittleness: I had very specifically tested the shovingsystem with particular inputs.
Now, it needs to access the '.target' component of the character, but the input data did not have that.
Turning this test into more of an integration-test like thing worked better.
