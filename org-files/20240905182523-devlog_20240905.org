I played around with some hitboxes, attack distances and attack patterns.
It feels a bit better now, but It's still now where I would like.

I think I should slow some things down, and maybe have aziorgh's hitbox lag behind the animation a little more so the player can dodge through it more easily.

What should I do next?
To get to my MVP I need to:
 - create the path 2 boss
 - create another path 2 enemy type
 - build a few levels for path 2
 - add a new early character, tutorialize the early levels
 - get a gauntlet of increasing difficulty running

I don't feel like any of that.
Am I burning out on my game?
Maybe I should focus on some other things.
