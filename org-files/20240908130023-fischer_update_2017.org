Fischer and Ullsperger review a variety of experiments showing that serotonin and dopamine interact in the reward system, such that combined they are more than the sum of their parts.

A number of interesting points stood out to me:

 - serotoninergic neurons in the DRN often co-release glutamate
 - most serotoninergic input in the forebrain comes from the DRN
 - SSRIs may reduce the co-release of glutamate from serotoninergic neurons (iiiinteresting...)
 - the regions that project to DRN 5HT neurons (but not MRN) are similar to those that project to VTA DA neurons.
 - lateral habenula has been suggested to mediate aversive signals to both.
 - "An influential hypothesis holds that 5-HT controls behavioral inhibition in an aversive context (Soubri√©, 1986)"
   This may well be worth looking into Re: learned helplessness
 - 5HT is strongly involved in punishement processing (consistent with the un-learning idea)
 - There is also evidence hat 5HT mediates reward processing
 -
