Fischer and Ullsperger review a variety of experiments showing that serotonin and dopamine interact in the reward system, such that combined they are more than the sum of their parts.

A number of interesting points stood out to me:

 - serotoninergic neurons in the DRN often co-release glutamate
 - most serotoninergic input in the forebrain comes from the DRN
 - SSRIs may reduce the co-release of glutamate from serotoninergic neurons (iiiinteresting...)
 - the regions that project to DRN 5HT neurons (but not MRN) are similar to those that project to VTA DA neurons.
 - lateral habenula has been suggested to mediate aversive signals to both.
 - "An influential hypothesis holds that 5-HT controls behavioral inhibition in an aversive context (Soubri√©, 1986)"
   This may well be worth looking into Re: learned helplessness
 - 5HT is strongly involved in punishement processing (consistent with the un-learning idea)
 - There is also evidence hat 5HT mediates reward processing
 - 5HT receptor expression displays a [[id:eba46644-a0ea-451e-807e-9ad1776ebfde][rostral]]-[[id:9fdca2cb-4045-44da-884e-61b91fdf3a41][caudal]] gradient, indicating particular importance for 5HT in higher functions
 - many 5HT neurons also release glutamate
 - Inputs to DRN 5HT and VTA DA neurons (but not MRN 5HT neurons) follows a similar pattern
 - PFC and LHb both provide input to both
 - stimulating PFC-DRN projecting neurons increases motivation in rats
 - LHb has been proposed to mediate aversive signaling to VTA and DRN

 These three seem to form a puzzling little trio, though the article doesn't frame them as such?
 - LHb seems to mostly inhibit DRN 5HT release
 - optogenetic silencing of DRN GABA neurons prevented the development of behavioral avoidance (could this be explained as passivity or helplessless?)
 - pharmacologically inactivating LHb seems to reduce stress-related behaviors

 - rodent studies have found that alterations in 5HT processing can affect either reward or punishment sensitivity depending on the type, strength, or duration of manipulation.
 - DRN innervates VTA DA neurons with both glutamate and serotonin
 - VTA GABAergically innervated DRN
 - DRN does encode reward likelihood and magnitude
 - SERT expressing DRN neurons respond to reward but not punishment
 - optogenetic stimulation of Pet-1 neurons in DRN is reinforcing
   this was much less in mice lacking the vglut-3 gene, indicating an important role for glutamate co-release.
   (this might be due to the glutamate multiplicatively up-regulating the targeted neurons, thereby amplifying their effect on the network?)
 - this was not replicated in a subsequent experiment. lol
 - targeting SERT+ neurons did not have the same effect (could be due to effects of SERT+ targeting on serotoninergic functioning more generally)

 - DRN innervates [[id:75649428-ad40-42e9-84a6-ddf74bff6748][mesostriatal]] VTA neurons with mostly glutamate but also serotonin
 - VTA innervates DRN with GABA
   
5HT has been strongly implicated in both reward and punishment processing.
