The early enemies have been tweaked and are working ok now.
I'm not sure what to do next.

I think the best thing would be to try and figure out the postgame gauntlet.
The tricky thing is handling obstacles, like cliffs and low logs.

I could shuffle preexisting maps, and just ignore the characters already on them.
The thing is I don't have any convenient way of ignoring characters added.

I think I need to rework the map loading a bit for this to work.
