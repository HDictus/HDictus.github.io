#+title: embarassment-of-empirical-riches

A phrase I absolutely love from Jaak Panksepp's Affective Neuroscience:

"There has been a great deal of of promising research in the fields of neurochemistry and neuropharmacology, to the point that there is now an /embarassment of empirical riches/ in these areas."
Affective neuroscience: the foundations of human and animal emotions, P. 361
