#+title: the-tension-between-progressivism-and-anticolonialism

Implicit in the belief that society can move in a better direction is the idea that some societies can be better than others.
This is a colonialist mindset : our social organization is better than theirs, we must change them.
Yet many progressives, myself included, are anti-colonialist.
Indeed, colonialism is one of the barbarous things we hope to progress away from.

How do we reconcile this contradiction?
