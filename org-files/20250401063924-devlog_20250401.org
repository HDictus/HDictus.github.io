Woke up early, workin on the game.
I've added the ability for Enno to throw his spear, and today I will make projectiles stick where they land.

Now they do.

This seems like a workable mechanic for the boss fight.
It feels good, feels hectic.
I'll make an alternating attack pattern.

I also need to make sure the footsweep turns a dash into a stumble.
Next I should create the soundtrack to go with the attack pattern.
