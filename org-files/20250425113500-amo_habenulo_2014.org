Summary of https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00955-6

NOTE: this study was conducted on zebrafish, the relevance to mammals may be severely limited.

Amo et al. found that neurons in the [[id:b268644d-4f50-4107-91e3-34bf853c425b][ventral habenula]] of the zebrafish responded to pain, and also to a conditioned stimulus predictive of pain.
This also led to activation of the medial raphe nucleus.

lesioning this pathway reduced avoidance learning but not panic.
optogenetic activation of ventral habenula had the same effect as pain
