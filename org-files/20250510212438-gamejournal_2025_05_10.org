Today I played some runescape with marissa.

It was mostly fairly relaxing, rythmic play.
Sarachnis, alching while safespotting skeletal wyverns, and royal titans.

Maybe because of the time it takes up, this game is holding me back as a developer.
I could be playing games with more novel experiences to reflect on.

Although, I'm not sure about that. The advantage of runescape is how easy it is to slot into bits of the day.
But if I want that, maybe I'm best off downloading little mobile games and giving them a try, instead of OSRS over and over?
